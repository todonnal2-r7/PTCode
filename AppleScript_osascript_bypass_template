(* This Applescript is intended to bypass Mac OSX Gatekeeper and can be launched in a Mac OSX commandline using 'osascript'.
It takes a base64 encoded Sliver payload (compiled for Mac of course), writes it to a file, decodes it into a binary
performs chmod +x on the resulting file, then executes the sliver. Tested on Mac OSX Catalina with Gatekeeper and SentinelOne active.
The sliver was not detected or blocked.

Modify filenames and such to match your purpose/pretext. *)
