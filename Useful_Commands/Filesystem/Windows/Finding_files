**To find where a specific file exists on the filesystem:

  dir /S <filename> //Supports wildcards

**To find any Groups.xml files that contain "cpassword" on the Domain Controller's SYSVOL: (For exploiting GPP)

  find /i "cpassword" \\<DC Name or IP>\SYSVOL\*.xml

**To find all files with a specific extension:

  find c:\Path\to\start\from\*.<extension>

**To find all files containing "password":

  find /i "password" c:\Path\to\start\from\*
    (NOTE: To avoid a lot of garbage output, target specific file types by changing the file extension after the '*')

**To see permissions on files:

  icacls C:\Path\to\files\*

**To find all files owned by a specific user and save the output to a file:

  DIR C:\*.* /S /Q|FIND /i "<username>" > C:\userlist.txt
