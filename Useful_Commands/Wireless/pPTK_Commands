Before doing anything, make sure you've setup a static route to the default gateway! This will avoid you losing access to your PTK after you attempt to connect to an AP using the wifi adapters:
  ip route <-- To see what the default gateway is
  route add default gw <gateway IP>

Turn off Networkmanager or it will screw with your Wifi adapters the whole test:
  Method 1: service NetworkManager stop
  Method 2: airmon-ng check kill (NOTE: This may not work in some cases, but method 1 has always worked for me.)
